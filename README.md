# PJSekai-Overlay English Guide

This is a guide on how to use [pjsekai-overlay](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi/pjsekai-overlay) for English people. This also includes how to navigate AviUtl, but only the bare minimum required for this purpose.

**DISCLAIMER:**\
I do NOT speak Japanese. I figured out everything by trial and error. Some parts of this guide *may be wrong*.\
As Nanashi said, this is a tool intended for Japanese people. If you're having trouble, do NOT ask Nanashi for help.
